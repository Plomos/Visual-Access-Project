<p> All the Cravings. Covered.  Grande Toasted Breakfast Burrito is a giant leap for breakfast kind

When your alarm goes off, there’s nothing you want more than to stay bundled up nice and cozy under your covers. We get that. But what if we told you that the stuff-of-dreams Grande Toasted Breakfast Burrito with steak actually has more in common with those sheets than you might realize? Getting one will make the getting-out-of-bed transition easier for you. Here’s the logic.
Think about it, the tortilla is nothing if not a blanket keeping all the warm goodness inside. Exhibit B: People, us included, refer to perfectly prepared scrambled eggs as ‘pillowy’. This choice of word can’t be a coincidence.
But perhaps the most important comparison that can be made between bedding and the Grande Toasted Breakfast Burrito? Thread count. In both cases, bigger is undoubtedly better. And we’ve put everything into weaving this delicious breakfast creation (at participating locations during breakfast hours only). Let’s count ‘em up:
It starts with the steak.Then double the eggs*. Potato bites. Pico de gallo. And three melty cheeses to bring it all together and toasted to perfection.
Many have tried, but there’s really no sleeping on the Grande Toasted Breakfast Burrito with steak.</p>

<p> Circles are for Squares.  OK not all circles; just the ones that you eat for breakfast. But we know one breakfast item that is most definitely not a square. The Breakfast Crunchwrap®.

Ever since breakfast has existed, it’s existed in the form of a circle sandwich. We know this, you know this, and everyone knows this. It’s a little played out if we’re being honest. And breakfast has basically existed since someone decided to eat food in the morning, which makes the standard circle breakfast sandwich undeniably outdated. We mean, really outdated. Just think how far back that dates? People have been eating food in the mornings forever. Therefore, breakfast has been around forever. Since the standard circle breakfast has been around for a while, we here at Taco Bell thought we would mix it up and bring some excitement back to breakfast. This is why we now have the Breakfast Crunchwrap®. Eggs, your choice of bacon or sausage, real cheddar cheese, creamy jalapeño sauce and a full hash brown in a very hexagonal, handheld breakfast. It’s the motorcycle to the penny-farthing. The Internet to the carrier pigeon. The lantern to the lamp. The mobile phone to the payphone. A payphone, you ask? See, you don’t even remember those things because it’s been so long ago. Our point was just proven. The circle breakfast sandwich is as outdated as a payphone. It’s all about the Crunchwrap. And one step further, it’s all about the Breakfast Crunchwrap®.

So basically what we’re saying is, to all you devout fans of the circle breakfast sandwich, you’re lame and need to get with the now. And the Breakfast Crunchwrap® is the now. We’d be worried about upsetting you circle sandwich fans out there, but this description will probably never be on daytime AM radio, so they won’t even hear this in the first place anyway.</p>
