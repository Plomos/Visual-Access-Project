<p>Bringing the Nachos in a Big Way.  The Veggie Nachos Party Pack is our biggest box of nachos ever

Nachos have a great history of being there when hunger hits. At the big game? Nachos. A quick appetizer before your meal arrives? Nachos. Nothing is quite as classic as a plate of nachos, right?

Well, we know you’ve wanted even MORE. So we went big (instead of going home) and created our biggest, most shareable box of nachos yet—the Veggie Nachos Party Pack.

The traditional plate of nachos just isn’t an ideal way to feed your whole crew. Now you may be saying, "Wait, wait, wait. Nachos for people? Like, multiple?" Yup. Gone are the days when nachos were simply an individual snack between lunch and dinner. The Veggie Nachos Party Pack is here to bring nachos into a new era. And help you bring the talked-about dish to your next hang.

The Veggie Nachos Party Pack isn’t the bowl of chips and a side of dip your friends are accustomed to. So, get ready to spread the news to everyone you know. Because when we’re talking about a party spread, we mean a bunch of nachos spread out in a really big box. Apologies to veggie platters everywhere.

Whenever your crew is wanting nachos, go to Taco Bell and get your hands on the Veggie Nachos Party Pack on the Veggie Cravings Menu (at participating locations for a limited time).</p>
